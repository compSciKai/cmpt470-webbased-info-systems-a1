### Technical Requirements

- Must use proper HTML tags, trying to incorporate the meaning of the element as much as possible
- Valid HTML structure (it must be valid HTML5)
- Do not need to add functionality to any of the links

### Stylesheet

Add style in a CSS file to create the appearances and behaviours below. A quick demo of the final product can be found here: https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/470/bobbyc/a/demo.mp4

- Hovering over the individual pictures will make a “see MORE” button’s opacity transition into view. It does not need to redirect anywhere.
- Pictures should be displayed four per row, with some space between them. When resizing the window and the width of the window is less than or equal to 770px, only two pictures per row should be showing
- The colors and spaces should somewhat match the demo
- Requirements that are not stated here are up for interpretation

### Technical Requirements

- Maked reasonable assumptions about text or colors.
- May only use CSS (no CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or preprocessors such as SASS),
- No JavaScript is allowed
